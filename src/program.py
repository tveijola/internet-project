This is a template that can be used in order to get started. 
It takes 3 commandline arguments and calls function send_and_receive_tcp.
in haapa7 you can execute this file with the command: 
python3 CourseWorkTemplate.py <ip> <port> <message> 

Functions send_and_receive_tcp contains some comments.
If you implement what the comments ask for you should be able to create 
a functioning TCP part of the course work with little hassle.
